Merge Sort is a quintessential **divide-and-conquer algorithm.** It operates by recursively breaking down an array into smaller subarrays until each subarray contains a single element. These single-element subarrays are inherently sorted. The algorithm then repeatedly merges these smaller sorted subarrays to produce new sorted subarrays until there is only one subarray remainingâ€”the fully sorted array. Its efficiency and stability make it a popular choice for sorting large datasets and a foundational concept in computer science education.
